\title{Pairwise motif enrichment analysis across a database of motifs
}
\description{
Test for pairwise motif enrichment in a set of genes of interest. The function performs a fisher exact test to calculte the enrichment of each motif combination for the set of selected genes, from the background genes in promoter.DB.}
\usage{
computeEnrichments(Genes, promoterDB = "promoter.DB")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Genes}{
list of the genes of interest}
  \item{promoterDB}{
promoterDB object}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
An R object with 3 elements. Each of the elements is a data frame with motif combination on the rows and the enrichment statistics on the columns. Each row corresponds to one-sided \code{\link[stats]{fisher.test}} for enirchment of a motif pair in the given gene set, based on combined occurence of the motifs in the plus, minus or both strands combined. The columns of the data frame are: 

p.value - the p.value of the Fisher test,

odds.ratio - the estimate of the odds ration from the Fisher test,

genes - subset of the genes that are enirched with the motif and 

p.adj.BH - the multiple test correction of the p.value with the "BH" adjustment.
